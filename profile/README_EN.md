# Underwater Intelligent Innovation Laboratory

[ [中文](./README.md) | English ]

Welcome to the **Jimei University School of Ocean Information Engineering - Underwater Intelligent Innovation Laboratory** GitHub page!

We are dedicated to research in key technologies such as underwater intelligent information perception and processing, autonomous navigation for underwater robots, underwater 3D reconstruction, and environmental modeling, integrating cutting-edge artificial intelligence algorithms to promote the intelligent development of marine technology.

## Research Directions

- **Underwater Image Processing**: Underwater image enhancement, object detection and recognition, semantic segmentation, etc.
- **Underwater Positioning and Navigation**: Multi-source fusion localization algorithms, underwater SLAM, underwater path planning.
- **3D Mapping and Reconstruction**: Underwater environmental 3D modeling based on vision and sonar.
- **Human-Machine Interaction Systems**: Remote operation systems, remote collaboration for underwater robots.
- **Underwater Intelligent Operations**: Development and integration of ROV/AUV control systems.
